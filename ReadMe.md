### Lukas Beinhauer

This page contains an R-script, designed to simulate data from multiple studies. The goal is to assess meta-analytic estimates of heterogeneity, and the impact of various kinds of variance on such estimates.

Currently, the following functions are contained:
- SimStudies2groups()

## SimStudies2groups()

The following function is designed to simulate data from multiple studies, in order to assess the impact of various kinds of variances on measures of heterogeneity. Sample sizes are samples for each study, with small sample sizes being stronlgy favoured.

The content of this script is subject to change, and will be developed over time.
